## Introduction

This application enables users to upload and download files from a server securely. It is designed to be simple and responsive across devices. The project utilizes **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Socket.io** (for future integration of real-time features).

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:
- **File Upload**: Upload files from the local system to the server.
